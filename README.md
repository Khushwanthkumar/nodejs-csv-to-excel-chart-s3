# nodejs-csv-to-excel-chart-s3
This repository contains a Node.js application that allows users to upload a CSV file, eliminates blank rows, assigns a serial number to each row, and exports the result as an Excel file with a Pie chart to represent the gender ratio. The application also uploads the files to AWS S3 storage and returns the file URLs in the API response.
